# Princeton Algorithms Part I & II

This repository contains my implementations of the code examples and programming assignments from the **Princeton University Algorithms, Part I and II** courses on Coursera, taught by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne.

## 📁 Project Structure

The code is written in Java and uses the `algs4.jar` library provided by the instructors.

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

### ✅ Using IntelliJ IDEA

1. Open the project in **IntelliJ IDEA**.
2. Press `Ctrl + Shift + Alt + S` (or go to `File > Project Structure`).
3. Navigate to the **Libraries** section.
4. Click the `+` icon → choose **Java**.
5. Select the `algs4.jar` file located in the `libs/` folder.

This will link the library with your project so you can compile and run the code smoothly.
